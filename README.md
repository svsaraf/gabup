#This is a social network clone I created. 

If you're looking at this you are most likely a potential employer. I don't usually put my projects on github, but you're free to ask me about the nuances of any of this and I'll happily explain it. I'll also probably (if you let me) talk your ears off about what my most annoying bugs were!

If you want to run and compile this yourself, go ahead and send me an email at svsaraf90@gmail.com. I didn't push to github the relevant settings files because this is a live site, and there are security implications. 

######What you would need to run this yourself (please email for details):
- app.yaml
- index.yaml
- django
- djangoappengine

- dbindexer
- autoload
- build



######Things you can do:
- Register with an email address
- Receive verification email from gabup
- Login using your username and password
- View posts designated as public
- View posts designated as private

- View your own profile
- Write posts with the above privacy features.
- Comment on posts. 
- Edit your profile bio
- Friend people

######Skills I needed to build this:

- Non relational database (Google App Engine)

  - Process login and registration
  - Unique models to store users and pseudonyms
